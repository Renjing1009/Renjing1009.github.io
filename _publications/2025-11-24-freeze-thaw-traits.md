title: "Functional traits shape tree growth response to winter freeze-thaw cycle and neighborhood crowding in humid temperate forests"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ren-2026-freeze-thaw-traits
date: 2026-02-15
venue: "Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"
excerpt: "We show that winter freeze–thaw cycles and neighborhood crowding independently reduce tree growth in a humid temperate forest, and that xylem hydraulic and other functional traits mediate species’ sensitivity to these stressors."
